## compas
This repository will explore ProPulica's analysis on Northpointe's tool called COMPAS, used for profiling of correctional offenders by their likelihood to reoffend.

The debate that has surged from the adoption of this tool across the judicairy system worldwide is quite fascinating. To me, it brings the issue of how as a society, we see machine learning as the potential to address our problems; forgeting perhaps, there are humans behind this technology. And that humans, afterall, are the ones who ultimately make decisions. 


My interest in the anaysis, is to reproduce the work of ProPublica to understand better the intricacies the debate. 
I am using the dataset they collected from the Broward County Clerk's Office in 2016 as a reference, since up until today, Northpointe - now called Equivant - has yet to release the data and techniques behind their technology.
